## Debugging
#### Text Editor
* [ ] Punctuation after Underlined/Bolding/Italics doesn't render properly
* [ ] If there is a asterisk MUCH after the last italicized word, It will think it connected
  * Basically, make sure to not check asterisks that are actively being used in words.
* [ ] Bolding is barely noticable
  * Seems like just turning the markdown text into same color as the plaintext will help a lot.
