## Debugging

#### Text Editor

- [ ] Cannot highlight and scroll at the same time? - Hard
- [ ] Can't Combine Formatting - Medium
- [ ] Can click to non-existant line in markdown mode, desyncing cursor.
- [x] Cannot use strikethrough keyboard shortcut.
- [x] Punctuation after Underlined/Bolding/Italics doesn't render properly
- [x] If there is a asterisk MUCH after the last italicized word, It will think it connected
  - Basically, make sure to not check asterisks that are actively being used in words.
- [x] Bolding is barely noticable
  - Seems like just turning the markdown text into same color as the plaintext will help a lot.
- [x] Can't put punctuation after subscript or superscript.
- [x] Features in top tool bar are not aligned.
