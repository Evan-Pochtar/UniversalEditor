## Debugging
#### Text Editor
* [x] Punctuation after Underlined/Bolding/Italics doesn't render properly
* [x] If there is a asterisk MUCH after the last italicized word, It will think it connected
  * Basically, make sure to not check asterisks that are actively being used in words.
* [x] Bolding is barely noticable
  * Seems like just turning the markdown text into same color as the plaintext will help a lot.
* [ ] Can't put punctuation after subscript or superscript.
* [ ] Features in top tool bar are not aligned.
